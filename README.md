# 3D Cursor Auto-Visibility V2.0.

# Summary
A minor improvement to the 3D Cursor viewport overlay adding a bit more automation to the 3D Cursors visivbility. It would be awesome if it could be integrated into the Blender 2.8. 

# Description
if the the 3D shortcut is pressed, it reveals the 3D Cursor but then when a different shortcut for a different tool, it automatically hides.  Itâ€™s a much better feature than assigning a shortcut and its really useful feature for other artists and save them from manually hiding and unhiding via viewport overlay too much. 

The 3D Cursor must be Hidden first via Viewport overlay. It doesnt Auto-Hide the 3D Cursor when it is already visible. It will just set the tool to 3D Cursor. This is for those special cases you dont want to Auto-Hide the 3D Cursor.

# Whats New in V2.0?
V2.0 now has a mini UI that allows you to customise the shortcut via a mini UI in the addon setting.

# How to install
1. Download '3D Cursor Auto-Visibility 2.py' 
2. Put the '3D Cursor Auto-Visibility 2.py' into the Addons folder in your Blender Directory  
3. Open Blender 2.8
4. Go to Edit>Preferences
5. Click on Addons tab and select/check the addon
7. Change the Shortcut to your liking.

# How to use
For 3D Cursor Auto-Visibility

First check if the 3D Cursor is Hidden via Viewport overlay. The addon should already do that for you. (It doesnt Auto-Hide the 3D Cursor when it is already visible. It will just set the tool to 3D Cursor. This is for those special cases you dont want to Auto-Hide the 3D Cursor)

Press the " \ "  for standard Blender, 27X or your own keymap preferences and " C " for Industry compatible keymap or whatever you changed the shortcut to.  When you use a different tool, the 3d Cursor should Auto-Hide for you.

For Tap or Hold for 3D Cursor Visibility:

For 3D Cursor Auto-Visibility+.py:

Tap " ; "  key or whatever shortcut you have set it to for toggling the the visibilty of the 3D Cursor on or off and to switch tools to either the 3D Cursor tool or the previous tool 
OR
Hold Down " ; " or whatever shortcut you have set it to in order to reveal and set the 3D Cursor tool and then on release will Hide the 3D Cursor and Set tool to the previous tool you were using.

It would be great if it could replace the existing shortcut for the 3D Cursor if it does get integrated into the blender build. Also, if anyone can suggest any improvements to enhance this add on further please let me know. Anyways keep making Blender even more awesome guys!!ðŸ˜€
