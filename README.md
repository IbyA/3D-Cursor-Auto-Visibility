# Reveal and Auto-Hide 3D Cursor Addon V1.5.

a minor improvement to the 3D Cursor viewport overlay and it would be awesome if it could be integrated into the blender. 

if the the 3D shortcut is pressed, it reveals the 3D Cursor but then when I press a different shortcut for a different tool, it automatically hides.  Itâ€™s a much better feature than assigning a shortcut and its really useful feature for other artists and save them from manually hiding and unhiding via viewport overlay too much. 

The add-on, also respects the users who prefer the 3D Cursor visibility permanently on too via an if statement checking whether the 3d cursor is already visible or not.  

I have attached the addon to this email. Feel free to take a look. I have set the shortcut to â€˜\â€™. It would be great if it could replace the existing shortcut for the 3D Cursor if it does get integrated into the blender build. Also Feel free to change the shortcut via keymap

Also, if anyone can suggest any improvements to enhance this add on further please let me know. Anyways keep making Blender even more awesome guys!!ðŸ˜€
