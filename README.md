# Show_Hide 3D Cursor Automation V1.2.
Blender Python Script/Addon. Shows and allows modification to the 3D Cursor Location when button is held down. Hides and switches tool when released

Transitioning from Maya to blender was really easy because everything I needed was in the UI and learning the Industry compatible keymap didn't take much time either. However, the 3D cursor feels odd coming from Maya. I wanted it to emulate the 'D' key for edit pivot in Maya. where you hold down the button and It reveals the edit pivot gizmo while allowing you to make all modifications. Then on release, it Hides away and cannot be edited.

If anyone coming from 3DS Max or Maya (Not sure about Modo, never used it) or using industry compatible keymap but finds the 3D cursor odd then use this addon.

Also, remember to call these operators in the keymap on Press and Release (Of course, you can change it to your preferences): ![](Call%20Operator%20in%20Shortcut.png)

I put mine on the \ key because it's not usually used in any software I know of.

Also, if anyone can suggest any improvements to enhance this add on further please let me know. Anyways keep making Blender even more awesome guys!!ðŸ˜€
